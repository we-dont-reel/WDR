“Life doesn’t always give you ‘shortcuts’,” he said quietly.
There was conviction in his voice — "this isn’t something I heard from someone else; it’s what I’ve lived through."
When the mind feels tired, we should give ourselves a ‘little pause’.
It’s not just about work — the soul too needs rest. 😌
Someone once said, “I won’t change my path, because it’s my dream.”
That confidence — that’s courage! ✨
It’s really life whispering a small message — ‘don’t stop’, "believe in yourself". 💫
