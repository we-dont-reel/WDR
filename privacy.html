<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>We respect your rights and are committed to ensuring transparency and security in handling any data associated with our platform. Our approach is designed to protect user privacy while maintaining the integrity and security of the service.</p>
    <p>All submitted content is stored in encrypted form, and we cannot view or modify it. We do not associate stored data with any individual, ensuring that user anonymity is preserved. This policy outlines what limited data is processed and how it is handled.</p>

    <h2>2. Data Collected</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>IP addresses are used for security, rate limiting, fraud prevention, and abuse prevention. They are processed in memory and stored as log entries. Logs are part of network events. There will be no further processing. They are never linked to any identifiable user. We take privacy seriously.</li>
        <li>Any user-submitted content is encrypted within the browser and then stored on the server. </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Security & Storage</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>IP addresses used for technical purposes such as rate limiting, bot prevention, and abuse protection exist in logs for reasonably longer periods, only for the necessary duration. This is solely for technical purposes. We never process them. They are stored as part of request header logs.</li>
        <li>Submitted content is stored in encrypted form on the server and cannot be accessed without the full link, including the hash fragment. No stored data can be linked to any identifiable user.</li>
        <li>The hash fragment is created in the browser. It serves as the encryption key, ensuring your content is encrypted before transmission. Since the hash fragment never reaches our servers, your data remains fully End-to-End Encrypted.</li>
        <li>If you do not agree with this approach, please refrain from using this service.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Link Expiry & Abuse</h2>
    <ul>
        <li> All links automatically expire after 100 days and will not work.</li>
        <li>Submitted data is stored in encrypted form upon creation and may be retained for extended periods solely for legal compliance or potential future law enforcement requests. This data cannot be associated with any individual, nor can its contents be decrypted at our level.</li>
        <li>Content removal requests from law enforcement, courts, copyright claims, or abuse reports will be reviewed and honoured accordingly. In such cases, the links will expire even before the standard 100-day period. Requests in this regard must include the full link and hash fragment, along with proof of ownership, screenshots, court orders, or other relevant documentation as applicable.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Legal Requests</h2>
    <p>We comply with applicable legal obligations and cooperate with law enforcement when required. Content removal requests will also be honoured. Any communication in this regard must include the full link and hash fragment, along with screenshots, court orders, or other relevant documentation as applicable.</p>
    
    <h2>6. Your Rights</h2>
    <p>You have rights under some jurisdictions to access, delete, or object to data processing. However, since all stored data is encrypted, we cannot proceed without the full link (including the hash fragment) and proof of ownership or identity verification. IP addresses are not linked to users, and we do not associate stored data with any individual. Without verifiable proof, we cannot process access or deletion requests.</p>

    <h2>7. Contact Us</h2>
    <p>For takedown requests, abuse reports, inquiries, or any communication, email us at <strong>hi@genzer.me</strong> (it ends with .me).</p>
