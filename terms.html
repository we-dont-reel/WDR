<h1>Terms &amp; Conditions</h1>

    <h2>1. Use of the Service</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>The platform allows users to generate and share encrypted content securely.</li>
        <li>You must not use the service for illegal, fraudulent, harmful, or abusive purposes.</li>
        <li>We strictly prohibit content related to betting, gambling, sexually explicit content, illicit sales, violence, hate speech, fraud, and any activities that promote harm, even if they are legal in certain jurisdictions.</li>
        <li>Any misuse or abuse of the service, including attempts to bypass security measures, may result in immediate termination of access.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. Responsibility</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Users are solely responsible for the content they create, upload, and share using our platform.</li>
        <li>We do not monitor or control user-generated content and assume no responsibility for its accuracy, legality, or appropriateness.</li>
        <li>Content that violates our terms, third-party rights, or applicable laws may be removed upon valid notice.</li>
        <li>We are not liable for any consequences arising from user-generated content, including reputational damage, financial losses, or legal action.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Availability</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>We aim to maintain a reliable service, but we do not guarantee uninterrupted, error-free availability.</li>
        <li>Service features may be changed, discontinued, or temporarily unavailable due to maintenance or unforeseen technical issues.</li>
        <li>We are not responsible for any loss of data due to system failures, network disruptions, or other technical difficulties.</li>
        <li>Access to the platform may be restricted for certain regions, users, or purposes, at our discretion.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>4. Jurisdiction</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>All data is encrypted before storage, and we cannot decrypt or associate it with any individual or country. Encrypted data is stored in India. If your country (other than India) mandates local data storage or restricts cross-border transfers, do not use this service.</li>
      <li>Users in other regions with strict data regulations must assess whether this service meets their legal requirements. If explicit consent is legally required but not obtained, the service itself may be considered non-compliant. Simply agreeing to these terms does not constitute valid consent for data processing under such regulations. This will be treated as a violation of the Terms.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Termination</h2>
    <p>We reserve the right to suspend, restrict, or terminate access to the service without prior notice if we detect violations of these Terms & Conditions or any activity that compromises the platform's integrity.</p>
    <p>Termination may also occur due to legal requirements, security concerns, or misuse of the service.</p>

    <h2>6. Liability</h2>
    <p>We are not liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, consequential, or punitive damages resulting from the use of or inability to use our platform. This includes, but is not limited to, data loss, financial loss, reputational damage, or any third-party claims arising from content hosted on our service.</p>
    <p>Users assume full responsibility for any risks associated with using the platform.</p>

    <h2>7. Changes to Terms</h2>
    <p>We may update these Terms & Conditions at any time without prior notice. Continued use of the service after any modifications constitutes acceptance of the updated terms.</p>
    <p>Users are encouraged to review these terms periodically to stay informed about their rights and obligations.</p>

    <h2>8. Contact Us</h2>
    <p>For any questions, concerns, or disputes related to these terms, please contact us at <strong>hi@genzer.me</strong> (it ends with .me).</p>
